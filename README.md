# Recreation of AMAZON Full Stack WebApp with React JS and Stripe Payments 

This Amazon clone was build using React JS, Node JS, Express and CSS. It itegrates Stripe payments, authentication and was deployed on Firebase. It utilizes modern ReactJS concepts such as functional components, Hooks, Context Api and reducer for global state management as well as React Router. The website is fully responsive and tries to recreate current Amazon's design concepts.


## Card Details

To test stripe payment enter following Test Credit Card details:

Card number: 4242 4242 4242 4242 <br>
Exp: 04/24 <br>
CVC: 242 <br>
ZIP: 42424 <br>

## Logic behind stripe payment implementation

Everytime customer is in the Payment section (Payment.js) app does an API call to the endpoint that was build on firebase cloud functions with express (Blaze account required) to get CLIENT SECRET. From the endpoint express server (on cloud functions) calls stripe to get CLIENT SECRET.
The reason client secret is called from the server and not front end is security (hiding stripe private key etc.)
In response API endpoint returns clientSecret back to the front end. From there frontend on submit sends payment request that contains client secret to stripe.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
